# User Behavior Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. 
The objective is to extract insights, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize business processes.

## Datasets
1. **UserDetails.csv**: Contains user demographic and registration details.
2. **CookingSessions.csv**: Logs of cooking sessions.
3. **OrderDetails.csv**: Details of user orders.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardized column names, handled missing values, and transformed date columns.
2. **Data Merging**: Combined datasets for comprehensive analysis.
3. **Data Analysis and Insights**: Explored relationships, identified trends, and extracted key insights.
4. **Visualizations**: Created charts to effectively communicate findings.
5. **Summary Report and Recommendations**: Documented findings in a report for stakeholders.

## Outputs
All generated outputs are stored in the `outputs/` folder:
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Final cleaned and processed dataset.
- `summary_report.txt`: Text-based summary of findings and recommendations.
- Visualization charts (e.g., `age_distribution.png`, `monthly_order_trends.png`, etc.).
